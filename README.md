# Learning

We are going to use two very intersting features of Hardhat:

-   **Mainnet Forking** which can simulate having the same state as mainnet, but it will work as a local development network. That way you can interact with deployed protocols and test complex interactions locally [more info](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/guides/mainnet-forking.html).

Only you need to include in hardhat.config.js:
```
 networks: {
    hardhat: {
      forking: {
        url: RPC_URL_PROVIDER,
      },
    },

```

-   **Impersonation**  that lets us send transactions on behalf of any address, even without their private key (you should use it with "Mainnet Forking" feature, not run in the real worl ðŸ˜„)
